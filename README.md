# Smart Cloud-Based Security System

## Description
This project is a **cloud-based security system** that detects if a **door or window is opened** and alerts users via an app and email notifications. The system can be **activated or deactivated remotely** through a mobile application, providing **global access and control**. When an intrusion is detected, an email alert is sent to the user and their relatives, ensuring **immediate awareness and response**.

## Features
- **Real-time Intrusion Detection:** Uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect unauthorized entry.
- **Cloud Integration:** Enables remote access and control from anywhere in the world.
- **Mobile App Control:** The alarm system can be activated or deactivated through an **MIT App Inventor** mobile application.
- **Email Notifications:** Sends an email alert via **IFTTT** to notify the user and their relatives upon detection of an intrusion.

## Tools & Components Used
- **Arduino IDE** (Programming environment)
- **NodeMCU** (Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (Detects door/window openings)
- **IFTTT** (Triggers email notifications)
- **MIT App Inventor** (Develops the mobile app interface)
- **Breadboard & Wires** (Circuit prototyping)
- **LED** (Visual indicator for system status)
