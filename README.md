# IoT-door-security-Alarm
We build our own security system which can detect if a door/window is opened. The alarm can be activated or de-activated through an app on the Phone and when an intrusion is detected it will also send a mail to you and your relatives warning them about it. Cool thing is that entire thing runs on cloud so it can be controlled from anywhere in the world.
